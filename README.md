# Bangkok Participatory Budgeting

Welcome to the Bangkok Participatory Budgeting project! This initiative aims to involve the community in decision-making processes by allowing them to voice their needs and preferences for local projects. By contributing in this project, you have the opportunity to help shape the allocation of resources and develop your community.

## Introduction

In Bangkok Participatory Budgeting, we believe that everyone deserves a say in how public funds are utilized. This project focuses on creating an open and transparent platform where community members can express their needs and suggestions for local projects. By leveraging community input, we can ensure that resources are allocated effectively and aligned with the actual requirements of the people.

## Community Involvement

The community plays a crucial role in shaping the Participatory Budgeting process. Here's how bangkok people can get involved:

1. Visit our website and list the projects they believe should be prioritized for your community.
2. Provide project suggestions without any restrictive conditions, ensuring transparency and preventing officials from making biased decisions.
3. Participate in discussions and consultations to help refine and prioritize the community's needs.
4. Support the initiative by promoting awareness among fellow community members and encouraging their active participation.

## Government's Role

The government acknowledges the importance of community needs and is committed to supporting the Participatory Budgeting process. Here's what the government will do:

1. Verify the authenticity and relevance of community needs and suggestions through proper referencing.
2. Compare and analyze data from multiple communities, if applicable to more than 1 community.
3. Combat corruption by refraining from purchasing items that the community does not require.
4. Publish transparent and easily accessible median prices on our website for reference and accountability.

## Timeline

Our timeline for the Bangkok Participatory Budgeting project is as follows:

- **June:** Collect data and gather input from the community.
- **July:** Evaluate and select projects based on community needs and available resources.
- **Note:** We will do our best to adhere to this timeline for the website, but unforeseen circumstances may cause slight delays.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the Participatory Budgeting project.
